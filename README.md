## About the Video Course
Scikit-Learn is one of the most powerful Python Libraries with has a clean API, and is robust, fast and easy to use. It solves real-world problems in the areas of health, population analysis, and figuring out buying behavior, and more.

In this course you will build powerful projects using Scikit-Learn. Using algorithms, you will learn to read trends in the market to address market demand. You'll delve more deeply to decode buying behavior using Classification algorithms; cluster the population of a place to gain insights into using K-Means Clustering; and create a model using Support Vector Machine classifiers to predict heart disease.

By the end of the course you will be adept at working on professional projects using Scikit-Learn and Machine Learning algorithms.
